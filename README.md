Title: Build a containerized web application with Docker

The application uses the following tools, which are installed on
separate containers, which are:
- Apache Server which serves the applications through the protocol
HTTP.
- MySQL database which stores all application information.
- phpMyAdmin (optional) to manage MySQL database.

The API provides the four primitive operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete.
A simple login system implemented, based on tokens.
